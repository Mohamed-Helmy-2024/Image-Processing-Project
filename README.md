# Image-Processing-Project
Pattern Recognition and Image Processing (Python + OpenCV + Tkinter)
An interactive GUI-based image processing tool built with Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter. The application allows users to load images, apply various filters and transformations, and detect patterns such as edges and shapes.

`Features:`

Load and display images in RGB or grayscale.

Apply noise (Salt & Pepper, Gaussian, Poisson) and filtering (median, averaging, low/high-pass).

Perform point transformations: brightness, contrast, histogram equalization.

Detect edges using Sobel, Prewitt, Laplacian, Canny methods.

Use Hough Transform for line and circle detection.

Apply morphological operations (dilation, erosion, opening, closing) with various kernels.

Save the processed output images.

Tech Stack: `Python`, `OpenCV`, `Tkinter`
